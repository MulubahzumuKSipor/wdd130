    <p>My name is Mulubahzumu Kemmeh Sipor. My friends call me Smalloo. I am going to be a software engineer, I know that because 
        I believe that I can do it. </p> <p>I love reading fantasy, action and adventures novels. I am 18 years of age. Currently 
            self-employed. I run my own internet cafe. On thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is their effort to spread the gospel while providing 
            quality education.</p> <p>I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for three years now. I believe that as a human 
        we can do anything we set our minds to, so I encourage everyone to continue down this path and to not give up.</p>
        <p>I welcome getting to know anyone in this class especially those who have experience in software engineering. Thank you for reading my Biography</p>
