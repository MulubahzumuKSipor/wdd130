    <p>My name is Mulubahzumu Kemmeh Sipor. My friends call me Smalloo. I am going to be a software engineer, I know that because 
        I believe that I can do it. </p> <p>I love reading fantasy, action and adventures novels. I am 18 years of age. Currently 
            self-employed. I run my own internet cafe. On thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is their effort to spread the gospel while providing 
            quality education.</p> <p>I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for three years now. I believe that as a human 
        we can do anything we set our minds to, so I encourage everyone to continue down this path and to not give up.</p>
        <p>I welcome getting to know anyone in this class especially those who have experience in software engineering. Thank you for reading my Biography</p>

      <p>Liberia is a country in West Africa, bordering Sierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire. On the Atlantic coast, the capital city of Monrovia is home to the Liberia National Museum, with its exhibits on national culture and history. Around Monrovia are palm-lined beaches like Silver and CeCe. Along the coast, beach towns include the port of Buchanan, as well as laid-back Robertsport, known for its strong surf</p>
